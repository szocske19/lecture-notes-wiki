Introduction to the Git Version Control System
==============================================

First of all you can find a lot of useful links at the [FTSRG cheat sheets wiki](https://github.com/FTSRG/cheat-sheets/wiki/Git) from visual tutorials to available git clients with GUI. Also there is a quite extensive [e-book](http://git-scm.com/book) about Git with nice images, it is recommended to check it out.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)):

"Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development."

EGit tutorial
-------------

[EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/) is an Eclipse built-in git client. It comes with most of the standard Eclipse distributions and probably you won't need to install it.

The easiest way to use EGit is to open the Git perspective. To do so press ctrl+3 and type git.
