# Model to model and model to code transformations

## The task

In this laboratory, model transformation will be presented,
specially one of this type: event-driven transformation, through an example.
This transformation will create (and then incrementally update while active) a
 relational database schema from any entity relation diagram.

## Environment setup

### Required Plug-ins Install

First, we have to install some plug-ins, if these are not installed already.

Install EMF SDK 2.13 and Sirius 5.1 or newer.
 *Help* **&rightarrow;** *Install New Software...* **&rightarrow;**
 In the new window paste the link below to *Work with*, select those plug-ins
 which selected in the pictures and *Finish*

![Sirius](/mdsd/2018/m2m/SiriusInstall.png "Sirius")

Same steps with Viatra 1.7.

### Projects

Clone [this](https://github.com/FTSRG/mdsd-examples) repository with and check out __1.0__ tag.

![Checkout](/mdsd/2018/m2m/checkout.png "Checkout")

From this repository we will use the projects below:

* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.erdiagram
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.erdiagram.design
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.m2m2c
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.m2m2c.ui
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.rdb
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.rdb.design
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.trace

### Resolving compile errors

After import there will be a lot of errors in the workspace,
but the following steps will resolve them.

First of all, you have to generate the model code from each genmodel
(they are located in the model folder in each project),
which are in the following projects:

* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.erdiagram
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.rdb
* hu.bme.mit.mdsd.trace

![genmodels](/mdsd/2018/m2m/genmodels.png "genmodels")

To generate model code, open a .genmodel file, right click on the root element,
and click Generate All.
__Order is mater__, _trace_ model have to be the last one
because it use the other two models.

After you’ve done that, clean all projects.

That’s it, you are all set now, the workspace should be errorless.

## VIATRA Model transformations introduction

Model transformation can be done in many different ways,
the most simple one is to write many for loops traversing the source model
to create the target model. However, it is more maintainable to use graph
transformation rules for such a task.

Note that we will mainly use Xtend.

Open _ErdToRdbLiveTransformation.xtend_ file in _hu.bme.mit.mdsd.m2m2c_ package of
_hu.bme.mit.mdsd.m2m2c_ project. Tip: use _ctrl + shift + t_ shortcut.

At this point the transformation use only one rule. This is the _entityRule_C_.
Note that C means create, D means delete and U means update.

``` Java
private def createTransformation() {

	// Initialize event-driven transformation
	val fixedPriorityResolver = new InvertedDisappearancePriorityConflictResolver
	fixedPriorityResolver.setPriority(entityRule_C.rule.ruleSpecification, 1)

	transformation = EventDrivenTransformation.forEngine(engine).setConflictResolver(fixedPriorityResolver)
	.addRule(entityRule_C.rule)
	.setSchedulerFactory(Schedulers.getQueryEngineSchedulerFactory(engine)
	).build

}
```

InvertedDisappearancePriorityConflictResolver add priority to
the rule (smaller number first). After that it can be added to the transformation.

Let's see what looks inside this rule. Open _AbstractRule.xtend_,
because  *EntityRule_C.xtend* inherited from this.
There is 3 Classes which must be mentioned.

* `IModelManipulations` - This interface provides to manipulate
the models easily wrapped in command.
* `EventDrivenTransformationRuleFactory` - helper class for creating
`EventDrivenTransformationRule`s.
* `RdbPackage` - provides EReferences, EClasses and EAttributes
from RDB domain model.

We will use EMF-IncQuery from Java in the model transformation, thus it is
important to understand how to use it beforehand.

For each query four Java classes are generated into the src-gen folder

* `[PatternName]QuerySpecification.java` - Represents a pattern,
containing its name, parameters, body, annotations, etc.
* `[PatternName]Match.java` - Represents a match of a pattern (parameters)
on an instance model, containing references to the EObjects.
* `[PatternName]Matcher.java` - Basically a query specification initialized
on a concrete instance model. The match set can obtained from it.
* `[PatternName]Processor.java` - Abstract class for defining an action on match.
* `[FileName].java` - IncQuery also generates a class for every .eiq
file containing the QuerySpecifications in a list.

Open *EntityRule_C.xtend*.  

``` Java
rule = createRule.name("EntityRule")
		// left hand side - queries a single entity
		.precondition(Entity_CMatcher.querySpecification)
		.action(CRUDActivationStateEnum.CREATED) [
		println('''EntityRule CREATED («entity.name»)''')

		// create table
		val table = traceRoot.rdbRoot.createChild(rdbPackage.relationalDataBase_Tables, rdbPackage.table) as Table
		table.set(rdbPackage.namedElement_Name, entity.name)
		val key = table.createChild(rdbPackage.table_Columns, rdbPackage.key) as Key
		key.set(rdbPackage.namedElement_Name, entity.name + "_ID")

		createTrace(traceRoot, entity, table)

	].build
```

``.precondition(Entity_CMatcher.querySpecification)`` line set precondition
of the rule to query specification of matcher of *Entity_C* pattern and the next line
set action which trigger the rule. This is *Created* action which means if an pattern
like *Entity_C* pattern appears, then this rule will be triggered. In this course we
will use *Deleted* and *Updated* too. *Deleted* means the rule will be triggered
if an pattern like in the precondition disappears.  *Updated* means the rule will be
triggered if an pattern like in the precondition changes.

Important note: Every rule must have an Created action
(it cloud be empty inside) rule to Updated or Deleted action can happen.

Let see Entity_C pattern, _ctrl + click_ in _Entity_CMatcher_.
It contains a Negative Application Condition (NAC),
with 3. parameter is Entity, let see that.

traceOfElement pattern looks like this:

![traceOfElement](/mdsd/2018/m2m/traceOfElement.png "traceOfElement")

Entity_C rule will match all entities which do not match in traceOfElement.

So now we know _EntityRule_C_ will trigger if Entity appear which is not traced
with an RDB element. It could be happen 2 cases:

1. A new Entity created.
2. An already exists Entity not traced any more.

Go back to _EntityRule_C_ and see the action. It creates an table in rdbRoot with
IModelManipulations extension (createChild), sets its name, creates a key in table
and sets the key's name too, at the end its. At the end it calls createTrace method.


Try out what we have now. Start an runtime-eclipse with this plug-ins.
Import _hu.bme.mit.mdsd.erdiagram.examplediagrams_ project from the repository.
May the project is not a modeling project, so convert to it, right click
on the project **&rightarrow;** _Configure_ **&rightarrow;**
_Convert to Modeling Project_.
Unfold _My.erdiagram_ and ER diagram inside it and
open _new EntityRelationDiagram_.

![ER-model](/mdsd/2018/m2m/ER-model.png "ER-model")

Right click on ER diagram **&rightarrow;** _Prepare to EDT_. This command creates
an rdb model and an trace model with just one-one root elements in those.
(F5 may be needed)

Create an representation to the RDB element inside the rdb model.
Open both representations at the same type.
And finally start the EDT, right click on the ER diagram **&rightarrow;**
 _Start EDT_.

After arrange the results should look like this:  

![ER-and-RDB-model](/mdsd/2018/m2m/ER-and-RDB-model.png "ER-and-RDB-model")    

Note: If you create an Entity it will appear as Table in the rdb model
with empty name, because when the entity created it does not have name.
But if you delete the table it will regenerated with right name.

## VIATRA Model transformations Tasks

### Create update and delete rules for Entities. (Worm-up)

Create an xtend file in _hu.bme.mit.mdsd.m2m2c.rules_ package, named it to
EntityRule_UD and copy the next snippet into it.

``` Java
class EntityRule_UD extends AbstractRule{

	new(ViatraQueryEngine engine, IModelManipulations manipulation, TraceRoot traceRoot) {
		super(engine, manipulation, traceRoot)

		rule = createRule.name("EntityRule")
			// left hand side - queries a single entity
			.precondition(Entity_UDMatcher.querySpecification)
			.action(CRUDActivationStateEnum.CREATED) [
			println('''EntityRule CREATED [empty RHS] («entity.name»)''')

		].action(CRUDActivationStateEnum.UPDATED) [
			println('''EntityRule UPDATED («entity.name»)''')

			if(!entity.name.equals(table.name)){
				table.set(rdbPackage.namedElement_Name, entity.name)
			}

			val key = table.columns.filter(Key).head		
			if(!key.name.equals(entity.name + "_ID")){
				key.set(rdbPackage.namedElement_Name, entity.name + "_ID")
			}

		].action(CRUDActivationStateEnum.DELETED)[
			println('''EntityRule DELETED («entity.name»)''')

			deleteTrace(trace)
		].build
	}		
}
```

The snippet refers to *Entity_UDMatcher* so create *Entity_UD* pattern in
_traceQueries.vql_ file.

``` Java
pattern entity_UD(entity : Entity, trace: Trace, table: Table){
	find traceOfElement(_, trace, entity, table);
}
```

Go to _ErdToRdbLiveTransformation_ and add *entityRule_UD* to the transformation
as like *entityRule_C*:

1. Add to fields the entityRule_C
2. Initialize entityRule_C
3. Set priority of the rule to 1
4. Add the rule to the transformation

### Create all rules to attributes
