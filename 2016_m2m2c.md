# Model to model and model to code transformations

## The task

In this laboratory, first we write a model to model transformation, which creates a relational database schema from any entity relation diagram. Secondly, we write a code generator generating a .sql file from the schema that can create all the tables and columns with appropriate types and constraints.

## Using EMF-IncQuery (VIATRA Query) from Java

We will use EMF-IncQuery from Java in the model to model transformation, thus it is important to understand how to ude it beforehand.

For each query four Java classes are generated into the src-gen folder

* [PatternName]QuerySpecification.java - Represents a pattern, containing its name, parameters, body, annotations, etc.
* [PatternName]Match.java - Represents a match of a pattern (parameters) on an instance model, containing references to the EObjects.
* [PatternName]Matcher.java - Basically a query specification initialized on a concrete instance model. The match set can obtained from it.
* [PatternName]Processor.java - Abstract class for defining an action on match.
* [FileName].java - IncQuery also generates a class for every .eiq file containing the QuerySpecifications in a list.

For example we can check a well-formedness constraint on a model in the following way:

```java	
public static boolean checkConstraints(EntityRelationDiagram model) throws IncQueryException{
	
	// Create a query enginge on the model
	EMFScope scope = new EMFScope(model);
	IncQueryEngine iqe = IncQueryEngine.on(scope);

	// Initialize a query on the model	
	RelationWithoutEndingsMatcher matcher = iqe.getMatcher(RelationWithoutEndingsQuerySpecification.instance());

	// Write on the console for each well-formedness constrain violation	
	matcher.forEachMatch(new RelationWithoutEndingsProcessor() {
		@Override
		public void process(Relation pRelation) {
			System.out.println("Relation without relation ending " + pRelation);
		}
	});

	if(matcher.countMatches() > 0) {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```
