Introduction to the Git Version Control System
==============================================

First of all you can find a lot of useful links at the [FTSRG cheat sheets wiki](https://github.com/FTSRG/cheat-sheets/wiki/Git). For example visual tutorials and git clients with GUI. Also there is a quite extensive [e-book](http://git-scm.com/book) about Git with nice images, it is recommended to check it out.
